## Welcome to the workshop of Machine Learning for Engineering Data Intelligence

**Date**: 13 July 2026

**Venue**: Xinjiang University, 666 Shengli Road, Tianshan Distric, Urumqi 830046, Xinjiang, China

### Synopsis:

In today's digital era, the increasing number of digital infrastructures coupled with the relatively low cost of storage devices has resulted in a huge amount of data in various forms (numeric, text, signals, images, etc.) being collected on a daily basis. Nevertheless, acquiring and accumulating data is of less value unless effective and efficient methods/tools are used to process and interpret the collected data. Machine learning methodologies, which include neural, fuzzy, and evolutionary computing models, offer the capability of extracting useful information and knowledge from databases to solve complex problems and assist in making informed decisions in practical environments.
This workshop is focused on big data analytics by using machine learning and related statistical methodologies, along with intelligent decision-making strategies under dynamic and non-stationary situations. Theory, application, and demonstration on how machine learning and statistical models can be effectively utilised to undertake big data and intelligent decision analytics challenges in manufacturing and industrial environments are presented. A number of real-world case studies will be presented, which include failure mode and effective analysis, high-mix low-volume manufacturing, electronic circuit design optimization, predictive maintenance, multi-objective process optimization, condition monitoring, and strategic technology investment. Hands-on sessions using machine learning software packages are included.

### Who Should Attend:

This workshop is ideal for professionals in various domains, ranging from engineers, computer scientists, data analysts, managers, to decision makers, who would like to enhance their knowledge related to big data and intelligent decision analytics in dynamic environments. The workshop does not require participants to have prior knowledge in statistics and machine learning methodologies. Industrial case studies are presented to illustrate the applicability and usefulness of the methodologies presented during the workshop pertaining to real-world problem solving.
